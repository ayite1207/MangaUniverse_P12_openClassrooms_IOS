            "synopsis": "After rigorously training for three years, the ordinary Saitama has gained immense strength which allows him to take out anyone and anything with just one punch. He decides to put his new skill to good use by becoming a hero. However, he quickly becomes bored with easily defeating monsters, and wants someone to give him a challenge to bring back the spark of being a hero.\r\n\r\nUpon bearing witness to Saitama's amazing power, Genos, a cyborg, is determined to become Saitama's apprentice. During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association. Wanting to boost his reputation, Saitama decides to have Genos register with him, in exchange for taking him in as a pupil. Together, the two begin working their way up toward becoming true heroes, hoping to find strong enemies and earn respect in the process.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now that his kind are no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet.

She asks her childhood friend, Hitoyoshi Zenkichi, for help and he grudgingly agrees, becoming the Student Council's lowest ranking member. Soon Medaka recruits two more people to the Student Council, the former judo club member Akune Kouki as secretary and the current swim club member Kikaijima Mogana, on loan for 300 yen a day, as treasurer.\r\n\r\nNow the Student Council members spend their days solving the problems submitted through the Medaka Box, whether they be hooligans in clubs where they don't belong, girls who need help writing love letters or people who've lost their pets, gradually earning the respect and admiration of the entire school.",

Even though he is underage, he spends most of his time working part-time jobs to make money to support his extravagant parents. As if that wasn't hard enough, his parents disappear without a trace one day, leaving him behind with a debt of almost 150 million yen.

Contemplating his jobless future, he decides to kidnap a wealthy child for ransom. And thus, when he sees a rich-looking blonde girl, he attempts to capture her.

The setting is based on the town Kasukabe in Saitama Prefecture. The main heroine is Konata Izumi, an athletic and intelligent girl who, despite these attributes, is not in a sports club, and has low grades. Her laziness at school is due to her love for anime and video games and lack of interest in anything else. The serialization began with the four main characters in their first year of high school: Konata Izumi, Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara. As the story progresses, they move onto their second and third year.\r\n(Source: MU)",

Among this crew are the often-bullied Pizza-tan, the cheerful otaku Keiji Nagaoka, the energetic bookworm Magister Takigawa, and the timid Aya Kitahara—the main source of Kurosawa's troubles during their time in school.\r\n\r\nThe trip is off to a rocky start as Kurosawa is berated by his girlfriend for not inviting her along with the group. Coupled with drama between Keiji and Takigawa and a tense ferris wheel ride shared by Kitahara and Pizza-tan, the gathering quickly becomes more and more uneasy. Though these longtime friends reunited to rekindle their old bonds, the strains in their relationship threaten to end their meeting in total disaster.   \r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mahiro Yasaka is a normal high school boy who is being chased by a fearsome black alien one night, until Nyaruko saves him. She explains that the creatures from H. P. Lovecraft's works are actually races of aliens, and that she has been sent to Earth to protect him from being kidnapped by an alien trafficker. Eventually, Nyaruko and two other Lovecraft-creatures, Cthugha and Hastur, ends up being freeloaders at Mahiro's place.\r\n\r\n(Source: MU)",

But that's just the start of Takisawa's troubles...the school tough, Ibuki Saburo, has set his sights on both mashing the new meat to a pulp, and winning the hand of Yukari away from any potential suitors...in the boxing ring! Will Takisawa be able to defeat Ibuki, win the love of Yukari, and still make it to Calculus on time? Of course, it's all in a day's work for a Blazing Transfer Student!\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as simply 'Red') is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going.\r\n\r\nDespite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sunred battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes are also mentioned from time to time.\r\n\r\nEach episode is divided into various shorts of varying length. Most of the humour comes from the interactions of the characters, especially the main trio of Sunred, his girlfriend Kayoko and General Vamp. Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.",

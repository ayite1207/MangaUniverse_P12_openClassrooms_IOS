            "synopsis": "In 16th century Japan, Shinmen Takezou is a wild, rough young man, in both his appearance and his actions. His aggressive nature has won him the collective reproach and fear of his village, leading him and his best friend, Matahachi Honiden, to run away in search of something grander than provincial life. The pair enlist in the Toyotomi army, yearning for glory—but when the Toyotomi suffer a crushing defeat at the hands of the Tokugawa Clan at the Battle of Sekigahara, the friends barely make it out alive.\r\n\r\nAfter the two are separated, Shinmen returns home on a self-appointed mission to notify the Hon'iden family of Matahachi's survival. He instead finds himself a wanted criminal, framed for his friend's supposed murder based on his history of violence. Upon being captured, he is strung up on a tree and left to die. An itinerant monk, the distinguished Takuan Soho, takes pity on the \"devil child,\" secretly freeing Shinmen and christening him with a new name to avoid pursuit by the authorities: Musashi Miyamoto.\r\n\r\nVagabond is the fictitious retelling of the life of one of Japan's most renowned swordsmen, the \"Sword Saint\" Musashi Miyamoto—his rise from a swordsman with no desire other than to become \"Invincible Under the Heavens\" to an enlightened warrior who slowly learns of the importance of close friends, self-reflection, and life itself.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Ten years have passed since the end of Bakumatsu, an era of war that saw the uprising of citizens against the Tokugawa shogunate. The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money.\r\n\r\nOne wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nNow in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\r\n\r\nIncluded one-shot:\r\nVolume 28: Meteor Strike",

Now that his kind are no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet.

However, there is something far more frightening than his ominous reputation: the fact that he is immortal. This is the handiwork of eight-hundred-year-old nun Yaobikuni, who placed bloodworms capable of healing almost any wound in Manji's body. \r\n\r\nTo atone for his crimes, Manji resolves to kill one thousand evil men. Yaobikuni agrees to this proposal, saying that if he succeeds, she will undo his curse of immortality. Soon after this promise, Manji meets Rin Asano, a 16-year-old girl who requests Manji's assistance in killing those who slaughtered her parents.\r\n\r\nInitially reluctant, Manji refuses Rin's desperate plea. However, owing to her evident lack of strength, Manji changes his mind and agrees to protect Rin for four years. With this partnership set in stone, the two embark on a perilous journey of bloodshed, vengeance, and redemption, each to fulfill their own life's cause.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Originally published with 219 chapters, which were then recollected into 207 chapters in the tankoubons.

Though once the Shogunate's chief executioner, his name is left in ruins after being framed for treason by the treacherous Yagyuu Clan, seeking to steal his position of power. His misfortune does not end here, however; they culminate in the brutal murder of his entire family, including his wife Azami, with only his child Daigorou still left alive.\r\n\r\nWith dishonor upon his head and his beloved wife in the grave, Ittou takes up a new mantle as an assassin for hire. Alongside his young son, Ittou wanders the country in search of revenge, with only the complete destruction of the Yagyuu Clan on his mind. As he travels the land, the number of his successful assassinations quickly grows, and soon the moniker of \"Lone Wolf and Cub\" becomes infamous across the land as the choice assassin to get the job done right.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when the spectators realize that the first match pits the one-armed Gennosuke Fujiki against the blind and lame Seigen Irako, even those with the most forceful objections declare the match to be a farce and the combatants' deformities an affront to their station.\r\n\r\nMost of the attendees are unaware of the deep-seated hatred Gennosuke and Seigen hold for each other, which stems from their struggle to become the heir to the insane samurai Kogan Iwamoto, leader of the notorious Kogan-ryuu dojo. Their once-cordial rivalry for Kogan-ryuu and the hand of Kogan's daughter Mie quickly turns violent when one of the young warriors angers the master, causing a chain of events that eventually leads to their severe injuries.\r\n\r\nShigurui chronicles the decisions that led Gennosuke and Seigen to this desperate point, as well as the many lives ruined by the brutality of samurai culture.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With Kankichi's help, Souichirou begins to establish a life in Edo's tenements and exchanges his longtime sword Kunifusa for a bamboo blade, due to his newfound desire to refrain from violence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Souichirou, avoiding conflict in Edo is not always possible. Before long, Souichirou finds himself stalked by the brutal assassin Shinnosuke Kikuchi, who delights in butchering anyone caught between him and his target. Each time Souichirou must step forward to defend himself or the people of the tenements, he reawakens the intense bloodlust of his younger days and resurrects memories he would much rather forget.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It's a world full of vengeance, greed, and violence. A world of depravity and sin. One man can set things straight if he can keep his wits. This is a story of extreme proportions, of sword study thick in tradition and with grim purpose, of blood rivers, agonizing screams, bondage, torture, and the evil prevalent in human failure. Drafted by the confirmed masters of the international medium of manga, Samurai Executioner is a shocking combination of darkness and fire, fine lines, and a fine man in the face of human decline.\r\n\r\n(Source: Dark Horse)",

But it turns out that the killer is a corrupt government official—and now the powers that be are determined to hunt Jintetsu down like an animal. There's only one problem: Jintetsu is already dead.\r\n\r\nTorn to pieces by a pack of dogs, Jintetsu's ravaged body has been found by Genkichi, outcast and master inventor. Genkichi gives the dead boy a new, indestructible steel body and a talking sword—just what he'll need to face down the gang that's terrorizing his hometown and the mobster who ordered his father's hit. But what about Otsuki, the beautiful girl he left behind? Steel armor is defense against any sword, but it can't save Jintetsu from the pain in his heart.\r\n\r\n(Source: JustManga)",

Yaiba lives with his father, Kenjurou, in the forest. One day, while Yaiba was eating, a troop of gorillas came to attack. Yaiba and his father escaped and hid inside a box, but they didn't know that the box was full of pineapples and was going to be transported into the city. In the city, Yaiba finds out that he is a legendary warrior and has to fight the evil of a demonic looking high-school student named Takeshi.\r\n\r\nThe people that Yaiba meets along his journey to become a true samurai encourage him, train him, or inspire him to greatness, though at heart he is still a child, and his incredible skill with a sword is matched only by his kindness towards his friends. Though, he tends to leap before he looks, and his thick-headedness tends to turn potential allies into enemies, though his friends soon clobber him, and salvage the situation. This unlikely group embarks on a host of incredible adventures where they meet legendary figures from Japanese history, and finally overcome impossible odds, and put everything on the line, to save the entire planet from a threat not of this world.\r\n\r\nIt's a story of love, friendship, hard work, and never giving up.\r\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The result of this were two changes: the first being the creation of \"Koishigawa Youjoujo\" for the people, the second being an inner-city magistrate office, known as the Mushibugyou.\r\n\r\nTsukishima Jinbee is a warrior who aims to be best, under the belief that a weak warrior isn't a warrior at all. He was scouted out by a representative to join the Mushibugyou and told to go to Edo with the instructions that he'd know what to do once he got there. Shortly after arriving at Edo, he hears a scream and goes to check it out... to find a giant spider-like creature devouring some citizens of Edo. Being a warrior, there's no way he could stand this...\r\n\r\n(Source: MU)",

With his world broadened by Nobunaga the Genius, and his spiritual insight learned from Senno Soueki the Master of Tea, Sasuke drove the road to hyouge. To live or not to live.

He really wasn't supposed to get it simply because he's a second son. 'cause of the way his pops and brother died he's got not a whole lot of self confidence so he practices fencing day by day at a nearby dojo. However because the people at that dojo are asses, he soon tries to invent a dojo and a style for people who just enjoy it.\n\nHowever what really sets this aside from most Shounen is that the main character male and female are actually married (At age 15 no less!) The girl Utagawa Shino is the younger sister of his senpai, and is a bit...weird to say the least. She makes rabbit masks to help bring in a bit of money, although to say that she's obsessed with rabbits would be an understatement. She claims its because \"The rabbits will someday reach the moon.\" When Gosuke invents his new dojo, he decides to make a style of swordsmanship known as \"Rabbit style fencing.\"\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 8: Yoshi!!",

This series traces the dramatic adventures of Keiji Maeda from personal conflicts with his adopted Maeda family, brave combat exploits, travels to the capital, and relationships with famous existing figures such as Iyeyasu Tokugawa, Rikyuu the tea master, and Hideyoshi himself, to experiences with the foreign and Japanese Christian faithful.",

Along his travels, he also met a blind monk who makes Zatoichi question his murderous lifestyle. In trying to help the town, Zatoichi kills some gangsters and becomes a hero to the boy. He must make a choice of whether to stay and defend the town or to leave and be on his way.\r\n\r\nZatoichi's Pilgrimage\r\nAfter he's ambushed in a small village terrorized by a gang of thieves, the legendary blind swordsman Zatoichi is forced to kill a young man in self-defense. As fate would have it, his travels soon lead him to Okichi, a woman whom Zatoichi discovers is the sister of the young man whose life he stole. In anger, Okichi attacks the blind swordsman, but her conscience gets the better of her, and as she tends his wounds, the two fall in love.\r\n\r\n(Source: MU)",

During this era, Hijikata Toushizou, determined to live by his own rules, led his reformed Shinsengumi--formerly a ragtag group of mercenaries that became the elite Samurai fighting force of the shogunate--to glory. This is the story of his life.\r\n\r\n(Source: MU)",

            "synopsis": "The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is a relatively tranquil kingdom, where the affluent Luxurors and poor Casualries exist within a caste system. Maintaining peace and defending its citizens from the demon threat is the samurai class, composed of individuals from both Luxuror and Casualry backgrounds.\r\n\r\nOne such samurai is a young Luxuror-born boy named Jonathan. From a young age, Jonathan has always dreamed of joining the order in hopes of being able to protect and serve his empire. Training beside him every day is Asuma, a young Casualry orphan. Driven by the death of his parents at the hands of demons, Asuma strives to become a samurai and eradicate them from their world. After a demonic incident occurs during one of their sparring sessions, Jonathan and Asuma are separated from each other until the day of the samurai prentice exam, 10 years later. The time apart has created a rift between the two former friends and causes them to no longer see eye-to-eye.\r\n\r\nShortly after the exam, the two boys are appalled to learn that samurai must utilize demons in order to effectively defend the people of the kingdom. While Asuma vehemently refuses to make any deal with the enemy, Jonathan's devotion to his beliefs wavers as he forms an unlikely partnership with a demon named Al. As the threat of illegal \"literature\" grows amongst the Casualry class and turning those who read it into demons, whose conviction will ultimately prevail?\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings.\r\n\r\nSetting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\r\n\r\nIncluded one-shot:\r\nVolume 14: Berserk: The Prototype",

            "synopsis": "Lurking within the shadows of Tokyo are frightening beings known as \"ghouls,\" who satisfy their hunger by feeding on humans once night falls. An organization known as the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG) has been established in response to the constant attacks on citizens and as a means of purging these creatures. However, the problem lies in identifying ghouls as they disguise themselves as humans, living amongst the masses so that hunting prey will be easier. Ken Kaneki, an unsuspecting university freshman, finds himself caught in a world between humans and ghouls when his date turns out to be a ghoul after his flesh.\r\n\r\nBarely surviving this encounter after being taken to a hospital, he discovers that he has turned into a half-ghoul as a result of the surgery he received. Unable to satisfy his intense craving for human meat through conventional means, Kaneki is taken in by friendly ghouls who run a coffee shop in order to help him with his transition. As he begins what he thinks will be a peaceful new life, little does he know that he is about to find himself at the center of a war between his new comrades and the forces of the CCG, and that his new existence has caught the attention of ghouls all over Tokyo.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hopelessly idealistic and romantic, Punpun begins to see his life take a subtle—though nonetheless startling—turn to the adult when he meets the new girl in his class, Aiko Tanaka. It is then that the quiet boy learns just how fickle maintaining a relationship can be, and the surmounting difficulties of transitioning from a naïve boyhood to a convoluted adulthood. When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought.\r\n\r\nAs his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness. Rather than curing him of his problems and conflicting emotions, this merely intensifies them, sending him down the dark path of maturity in this grim coming-of-age saga.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although the atmosphere in Tokyo has changed drastically due to the increased influence of the CCG, ghouls continue to pose a problem as they have begun taking caution, especially the terrorist organization Aogiri Tree, who acknowledge the CCG's growing threat to their existence.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a special team, known as the Quinx Squad, may provide the CCG with the push they need to exterminate Tokyo's unwanted residents. As humans who have undergone surgery in order to make use of the special abilities of ghouls, they participate in operations to eradicate the dangerous creatures. The leader of this group, Haise Sasaki, is a half-ghoul, half-human who has been trained by famed special class investigator, Kishou Arima. However, there's more to this young man than meets the eye, as unknown memories claw at his mind, slowly reminding him of the person he used to be.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Lonely high school student Kei Kurono isolates himself out of a growing cynicism toward his fellow man and the cruelty they are capable of enacting. One day, while waiting to take the subway to school, Kei's classmate Masaru Katou leaps onto the tracks in an effort to save a drunk man. Driven by an uncharacteristic desire to rescue someone else, Kei follows Katou down into danger. While successful in saving him, the two boys are killed by the train.\r\n\r\nKei wakes up beside Katou in an apartment full of strangers and furnished by a giant black orb with a glass-like outer surface. After finding out that everyone in the room has recently died, words appear on the black ball tasking them with killing a strange creature. The ball equips Kei and the others with power suits and mysterious guns before sending them off to collect this bizarre bounty.\r\n\r\nAlthough Kei discovers the mission to be far more deadly than originally suspected, he manages to survive. He is teleported back to the apartment where he and the other survivors are rewarded point values according to their actions in battle by the black sphere, which a fellow survivor says is called \"Gantz.\" Despite his death earlier that day, Kei is granted the ability to return to his daily life with one condition: he can be uprooted from his day at any time and summoned back to the apartment, where Gantz will task him and other recently deceased with the assassination of another target. \r\n\r\nWhile Katou dreads the inevitable return to Gantz, Kei finds himself living for the sole purpose of carrying out these missions. Thriving in the heat of battle and learning to care about himself and his comrades, Kei faces escalating monstrous threats that begin to bleed out into his normal life outside of Gantz.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

And probably not for the better.\r\n\r\nKenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop.\r\n\r\nKenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement. Disgraced and shunned by his colleagues, Tenma loses all hope of a successful career—that is, until the mysterious killing of Heinemann gives him another chance.\r\n\r\nNine years later, Tenma is the head of the surgical department and close to becoming the director himself. Although all seems well for him at first, he soon becomes entangled in a chain of gruesome murders that have taken place throughout Germany. The culprit is a monster—the same one that Tenma saved on that fateful day nine years ago.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Takao Kasuga is an unsociable middle school student who bears a love for books; in particular, Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal. He also has a crush on his class' idol, the sweet Nanako Saeki. In stark contrast to her, Sawa Nakamura is an insolent and unpleasant girl who lacks any concern for school. \r\n\r\nOne day, Takao forgets to bring his book home with him. He returns to school to retrieve it, but is stopped in his tracks when he finds Nanako's freshly worn gym clothes lying on the floor. A strange desire consumes Takao, and like a wicked pervert, he steals them.\r\n\r\nAku no Hana is a compelling coming-of-age story centered around Takao's thoughts, feelings, and relationships as he tries to live a normal life with the guilt of his crime weighing on him.  Sawa, however, who witnessed Takao's thievery, has other plans in store for him... \r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Using erotic thoughts of his female classmates as stimulus, he locks himself daily in a seldom-used girl's bathroom at school to do his dirty deed.\r\n\r\nOne day during class, Kurosawa witnesses the popular girls bullying the timid Aya Kitahara. Although not one to be riled over such matters, he decides to deliver retribution with his own hands. In a daring move, he steals the uniforms of the bullies and dispenses his \"white justice\" over them.\r\n\r\nAlthough satisfied with his exploits, Kurosawa's troubles are only just beginning. While going about his daily routine, he is suddenly confronted by Kitahara, who identifies him as the culprit behind the uniform incident, and blackmails him into terrorizing the other girls in the class the same way he dealt with her bullies. Left with little choice, Kurosawa agrees, and thus begins a coming-of-age story that deals with consequences, bullying, and people's ability to change.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, this is not the source of Jin's insurmountable terror: the thing that he fears more than anything else is his own father.\r\n\r\nTo most, Jin's father is a successful businessman, good samaritan, and doting parent. But that is merely a facade; in truth, he is a deranged serial killer—and Jin is his unwilling accomplice. For years, they have been carrying out this ruse with the police being none the wiser. However, when his father takes an interest in the pretty transfer student Yoon Kyun, Jin must make a decision—be the coward who sends her to the gallows like all the rest, or be the bastard of a son who defies his wicked parent.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The impact melted the continental ice mass and drastically raised sea levels, damaging the world's climate and causing the deaths of over half its population. Now in 2015, devastating creatures of unknown origin—referred to as \"Angels\"—ravage what remains of the planet. \r\n\r\nIn the heavily fortified city of Tokyo-3, 14-year-old Shinji Ikari is destined to halt the Angels' onslaught. Recruited by his father's secret organization NERV, Shinji is enlisted as a pilot of an Evangelion, a massive bioorganic android created solely to defeat the Angels.\r\n\r\nSuddenly with the weight of the world upon his shoulders, Shinji must find the courage and drive to stand up for the future—and himself. But as skirmishes between the Evangelions and Angels become recurrent, the horrifying truth of the world is slowly revealed.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Shinichi Izumi is a 16-year-old high school student who lives with his parents in a quiet neighborhood. One night, a Parasite invades Shinichi's body in an attempt to take control of it. However, it fails to complete the takeover process and ultimately ends up inhabiting only his right arm. \r\n\r\nThus, both Shinichi and the Parasite—who calls himself Migi—retain their individual minds. Now in a peculiar \"human and alien\" relationship, Migi proposes that they cooperate to survive. Shinichi has no choice but to agree, and he must now cling to his morality as he and Migi face off against other bloodthirsty Parasites.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unless the rabbits can identify their enigmatic predator, the wolf will eliminate one of them every turn until the whole colony has been wiped out.\r\n \r\nPlayers of the game often convene in real life, which is exactly what Yuu Aikawa does when he meets Rei Hazama, Haruka Akechi, and Eiji Hoshi. Together with Yuu's longtime friend, Mitsuki Houyama, the group decides to spend their time in a lively karaoke bar. During their revelry, Yuu leaves to check on one of his inebriated friends, but is suddenly knocked out by an unknown figure wearing a misshapen rabbit mask. After regaining consciousness, he finds himself in an abandoned psychiatric hospital, sharing a cell with a mysterious boy. Though the two soon manage to locate the others, their reunion is interrupted by a spine-chilling message in a cellphone: \"Rabbit Doubt, Start!\"\r\n \r\nIn Doubt, six high schoolers are thrust into a life-or-death survival game that will test their integrity and trust. With their lives at stake, they must quickly uncover the identity of the wolf that infiltrated their group—or be hunted down like prey.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Initially rejecting the offer, he doubles back on his decision after his car gets towed off. Nakoshi agrees to let Manabu Ito, a 22-year-old medical student, drill a hole in his skull in exchange for 700,000 yen. The procedure bears no results at first, with Nakoshi showing no abnormalities. This normalcy comes to an abrupt end, however, when Nakoshi begins seeing the homunculus in every person. With his perception distorted, how will Nakoshi face these homunculi?\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, he achieves the game's 10th global rank. Unfortunately, his celebration is cut short when he wakes up to an exotic sight—a remote island far from the comfort of his room. \r\n\r\nIt soon becomes clear that a nefarious party has whisked Ryouta and many other individuals—including the blonde bombshell Himiko and real estate agent Kiyoshi Taira—into a harrowing, real-life game of Btooom!

With his life now on the line, Ryouta must muster the courage and determination to survive in this hellish free-for-all, where the only way out is to kill seven other players.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She asks her childhood friend, Hitoyoshi Zenkichi, for help and he grudgingly agrees, becoming the Student Council's lowest ranking member. Soon Medaka recruits two more people to the Student Council, the former judo club member Akune Kouki as secretary and the current swim club member Kikaijima Mogana, on loan for 300 yen a day, as treasurer.\r\n\r\nNow the Student Council members spend their days solving the problems submitted through the Medaka Box, whether they be hooligans in clubs where they don't belong, girls who need help writing love letters or people who've lost their pets, gradually earning the respect and admiration of the entire school.",

            "synopsis": "When diver Tadashi and his girlfriend Kaori Sawahara take a trip to the coast of Okinawa, they find that their strained relationship is the least of their worries when they unwittingly witness the start of the apocalypse. Attacked by a strange, four-legged fish in their cabin, they manage to kill it, but are left unsettled by the putrid stench it carried—the haunting smell of death.\r\n\r\nThis lone assault is only the herald of what's to come, as soon, many more such creatures emerge from the sea, attacking anything in their path. Though Tadashi and Kaori quickly return to Tokyo, they find there is no longer any safe haven; no matter where they run, the death stench creeps...\r\n\r\nAmigara Dansou no Kai (The Enigma of Amigara Fault)\r\nAfter a devastating earthquake near Amigara mountain, a several-kilometer-long fault emerged. But this discovery was made more eerie by the thousands of human-shaped holes scattered among the rock face, each of which seemingly continues for miles within the mountain. Oowaki, one of the many spectators attracted to the sight, witnesses in horror as onlookers start to experience a personal, visceral calling to enter these holes—formed as if to fit only them.\r\n\r\nDaikokubashira Hiwa (The Sad Tale of the Principal Post)\r\nCelebrating their recent move into their new house, a family's festivities are cut short upon hearing the cries of their father. Finding him in the crawl space below, they bear witness to the bizarre and unexplainable tragedy that has befallen him.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With his weakened mind, Bum has found solace in watching his handsome classmate Oh Sangwoo; Bum's love runs so deep, in fact, that he has begun stalking him. While creeping in Sangwoo's house one day, Bum makes a horrifying discovery—a torture chamber and a naked young woman tied up, gagged, and pleading for help.\r\n\r\nThe life of this woman is doomed, and Bum cannot escape either, as he is soon discovered. His eyes sickening and crazed, Sangwoo takes Bum as his newest pet and victim. What awaits the mentally tortured Bum is a world of physical mutilation, toxic dependence, and abuse masquerading as so-called love.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is what Mori Buntarou trains, works, and lives for.\r\n\r\nHis climb to the top starts when he transfers to a new high school. Despite his lonesome and solitary nature, Mori's classmates persuade him to climb the school building. Without a harness or hesitation, he begins his scale to reach the top. Edging past the point of no return, he halts when he is faced with a final intimidating obstacle—a horizontal overhang. Adrenaline courses through him, and Mori jumps for the final hold at the summit.\r\n\r\nFrom there, he casts his eyes upon something that he normally would not have seen—another peak, another goal. With an awakened passion and newfound purpose in life, Mori explores the breathtaking sport of rock climbing.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At this seemingly perfect institution, the reserved Kiyotaka Ayanokouji arrives as an incoming member of class 1-D, where he befriends one of his classmates, the antisocial Suzune Horikita.\r\n\r\nAt first, his peers revel in the academy's leisurely lifestyle, taking advantage of all of its state-of-the-art facilities. Soon enough, however, the facade of Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School gives way to its true nature—only the top scoring classes can fully utilize the school's offerings, and Class D is the furthest from such a status. Standing at the bottom of the hierarchy, Class D houses all of the school's \"worst\" students.\r\n\r\nFollowing this rude awakening, Ayanokouji, Horikita, and the rest of Class D must overcome their differences and clash against other classes in order to climb to the coveted position of Class A by any means necessary.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Tatsuhiro soon realizes that socializing may be too far-fetched a dream for him, as he struggles to get through even the most basic interactions with others.

However, unlike other schools, students at Hyakkaou do not pride themselves on academic achievement. Instead, they value strategic prowess and the ability to read people. Come nightfall, many places on campus transform into gambling dens overseen by the student council, where players compete for rank, money, and more.\r\n\r\nRyouta Suzui spends his days as a \"house pet\"—a student ranked in the bottom one hundred, forced to serve his peers. His circumstances soon change when a mysterious new transfer student, Yumeko Jabami, arrives at the academy. Despite Suzui's warnings, Yumeko quickly becomes immersed in the school's gambling scene, facing off against several high-profile opponents. Her exploits draw the attention of the student council members, who start meddling in her affairs. Suzui tries his best to keep Yumeko out of trouble, but to his chagrin, she turns out to be the type of person best suited to attend Hyakkaou: a compulsive gambler.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The year is 2017, and Ryuk deems that high school student Minoru Tanaka may have the brains to continue what Kira had started, or at least he will provide him with some decent entertainment. \r\n\r\nRevealing himself to Minoru, Ryuk offers the Death Note to him and explains its rules. However, after long and careful deliberation, Minoru proposes a counter-offer: he will decline the Death Note for now, but should Ryuk return in two years, Minoru will surely grant his wish.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Ryuk returns to Minoru, who gladly accepts the notebook and sets his scheme in motion. The Japanese police, the mysterious detective L, and the entire world soon come to witness Minoru's meticulous plan: one that makes unprecedented use of the Death Note's devastating powers.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Crezant immediately launches into a fantastical story: the powerful mage Animus intends to destroy the earth with his biscuit hammer, a huge contraption looming high in earth’s orbit. Earth’s only hope lies with the princess and her Beast Knights, whose task is to protect the princess and defeat Animus.\r\n\r\nYuuhi is chosen as the Lizard Beast Knight, and despite his misgivings, is quickly forced to defend himself from a golem created by the mage. He is saved by his neighbor, the princess Asahina Samidare, and swears loyalty to her. However, the princess does not intend to save the earth at all. She lets Yuuhi in on her real motivations: to prevent Animus from destroying the earth, only to then annihilate the planet by her own hand. The pair continue to fight off attacks by Animus’s golems while the remaining Beast Knights are slowly being gathered and learning to use their powers. But Yuuhi will have to decide for himself whether to go along with Asahina’s plans, whom he is getting close with, or to save the earth. In the process, he must also confront his true self, and determine where his loyalties truly lie. \r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He aids his son from behind the scenes as he evades and eventually with the help of mercenaries from Nomad (some of them former Propater operatives) fights the Propater. As the plot develops focus shifts away from the main character and develops many sub-plots dedicated to terrorism, Human-improvement, the struggle of the developing countries and the power battles between the drug cartels and Propater.\r\n\r\nBased strongly on Gnostic mythology, all major characters are named after gnostic deities, and have analogous roles.\r\n\r\n(Source: MU)",

After hanging out at a bar, Arisu and his best friends, Daikichi Karube and Chouta Segawa, wait for the first train to arrive in the morning. Suddenly, a colorful array of fireworks set off in the sky, and an enormous blinding firework renders them unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe trio finds themselves back at the bar covered in dust, discovering that the city has become a barren wasteland. But instead of being worried, Arisu feels alive for the very first time in his life and relishes the freedom of this lifeless city. However, his bliss is cut short when the group rashly enters a festival venue. Seeing its delicacies and lively ambiance, they think the place is a dream; unbeknownst to them, it will be the setting for their first deadly game.\r\n\r\nTogether with his friends, Arisu slowly enters the mysterious area known as the Borderland—an unknown country where every game puts their lives at stake, and a single misstep can lead to their demise.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Danger looms over the horizon; a deadly virus—capable of killing within three hours of infection—has now fallen into the hands of a mysterious woman named Maya.\r\n\r\nEnter Fujimaru Takagi, a seemingly ordinary student at Mishiro Academy in Japan. However, very few know that he was famed for exposing crimes and corruption of high-profile individuals with his brilliant hacking powers—the infamous \"Falcon\" who had abruptly vanished from the cyberworld. Only the members of Third-I, a top-secret division of the Public Security Intelligence Agency led by Fujimaru's father Ryunosuke Takagi, and his friend Otoya Kujou know of his past.\r\n\r\nWhen a KGB agent is murdered in Japan, the only clue to his death is a memory chip found at the scene of the crime. Fujimaru is recruited by Third-I to decode the chip, which contains a video file of an event called the \"Christmas Massacre.\" Investigating the incident further, Fujimaru's father uncovers more information about the homicide and a mysterious code, \"Bloody Monday,\" before being framed for the murder of his superior. Now, it is up to the hacker Fujimaru to utilize his expertise to help Third-I prevent the spread of terror and destruction in Japan, while attempting to clear his father's name.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

These powers manifest themselves in the form of visual cues and range from lie detection to danger prediction. Unfortunately, high school student Tooru Mizushima is one of the very few without an Iris. As an \"Iris Zero,\" he is frequently bullied, and therefore, he tries to stand out as little as possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the popular schoolgirl Koyuki Sasamori comes crashing into Tooru's life, his motto of minimal exposure is brutally shattered. Koyuki's Iris allows her to identify the most qualified person for a certain task—and she determines Tooru to be the most capable person to help her find the next student council president.\r\n\r\nTooru refuses to become involved in such a public affair, but Koyuki's cheerful persistence ultimately prevails. And so, Tooru's lonely life as an Iris Zero slowly changes as he comes to meet more people and utilize his exceptional deduction skills to solve various mysteries.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But as his series becomes a massive hit, Kevin discovers that his famed character, Billy Bat, already existed before within a Japanese comic. Worried that he may have unconsciously copied something he saw during his time there, Kevin returns to Japan to find Billy Bat's original creator and seek permission for him to use their character. However, as he traces back Billy Bat's roots, he finds himself unraveling a dark and twisted history of murders that somehow involve the character he thought he created.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the body of Arie Kimura's mother is found by this tunnel's entrance, next to apparently human traces, the legend seems to be confirmed. Is the end of the world coming? In order to appease the wrath of the beast, the children decide to offer it a sacrifice: The unfortunate Arie, whom they believe to be the cause of the curse, is shoved into a well that leads to the Nijigahara tunnel—an act that in turns pushes Komatsuzaki, the budding thug who has carried a torch for Arie for a while already, entirely over the edge.\r\n\r\nBut this is only the beginning of the complex, challenging, obliquely told Nijigahara Holograph, which takes place in two separate timeliness and involves the suicidal Suzuki; Higure, his stalker-ish would-be girlfriend; their teacher Miss Sakaki, whose heavily bandaged face remains a mystery; and many more―brothers, sisters, parents, co-workers, teachers, aggressors and victims who are all inextricably linked to one another and all will eventually―ten years later―have to live with what they've done or suffered through.\r\n\r\n(Source: Fantagraphics)",

From socializing to buying things in real life, the app has become indispensable in daily life, especially for second-year high school student Ataru Kashigawa. He uses Real Account as a means to escape reality and he feels a sense of belonging and connection to his followers, whom he considers as his friends.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ataru's views on friendship drastically change when he gets plunged into the virtual world of Real Account and is forced to participate in horrific death games alongside ten thousand other users. But these are far from ordinary online death games as dying in the world of Real Account means that you and all your followers die in reality. To make matters worse, having no followers also means certain death. As Aratu begins to participate in these death games, he discovers the existence of Yuuma Mukai, a teenager who looks just like him. This discovery creates a twist in events.\r\n\r\nBetrayed by his so-called friends one by one, Ataru is left with one anonymous follower.

In contrast, his childhood friend Sakuko Akiyama sees past the nothingness of their gloomy town and dreams of the chaotic glamor of Tokyo.\r\n\r\nAs a way to withdraw from his monotonous life, Reiji finds comfort in watching the performances of \"Acrylic,\" an idol group, and its most beautiful member, Nagi Aoe.

Robbed of his innocence, Reiji struggles to wade through the abyss of sin he has been pulled into, all while an intricate web of lies, obsession, and betrayal threatens to tear him apart.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While he is away from home, his artificial daughter Fran takes over the mansion and his grisly surgical practice. With the aid of her violent younger sister Veronica, the human-cat hybrid Okita, and Dr. Madaraki's other macabre creations, Fran deals with the unusual requests of her clients. From tumor removal to reviving the dead, no two jobs are alike, but no job is too difficult—or too dangerous—for the successor to Dr. Madaraki. This eccentric medical prodigy is willing to do anything to save a life, even if her results are seldom pretty.\r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\r\n\r\nIncluded one-shot:\r\nVolume 7: Phase 20",

Out of the remains of the corpse comes forth a Daruma doll, marking the beginning of a sadistic game. All who move when the Daruma is looking will be killed, and the winner is the one to push the button on the Daruma's back.\r\n\r\nShun manages to remain calm through the slaughter of his classmates and becomes the sole victor in his class. But upon the game's completion, he finds that he is still locked inside the school and is forced to play through another hellish event. Who exactly is concocting these mysterious games, and is there any end in sight? Shun gives his all to find other survivors and work together to survive the Daruma's murderous tests.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to their strong fascination with murder and highly-developed analytical skills (along with some luck), they manage to solve the murders that have eluded even the authorities. Often, it is Kamiyama that solves the bulk of the crimes, down to the smallest of details. But there's only one thing he is interested in; by which method should Morino be killed.\r\n\r\n(Source: MU)",

Inside are several computers, along with a man named Kokopelli who offers the students a chance to play a game: one where they use a gigantic robot to defeat enemies who attack the Earth. The children agree to sign a contract by touching a shield-like object, and Kokopelli transports them to the cockpit of the Zearth—the mecha they are to pilot.\r\n\r\nAfter an enemy mecha rises from the sea, Kokopelli shows them how to mentally control the Zearth, and defeats it. The children are excited by the prospect of defending the Earth, but not everything is as it seems. The Zearth is in fact powered by life energy, and at the end of every battle, the pilots die. After signing their lives away, the children must now use their time left on Earth to defend it.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Toua Tokuchi, a master of gambling and mind games, holds the remarkable record of 499 wins and zero losses in \"One Outs,\" a simplified form of baseball that consists of only a batter and a pitcher. Visiting Okinawa, Tokuchi's hometown, is Hiromichi Kojima, the star batter of the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons, the weakest team in the Japanese baseball league. Dreaming of leading the Lycaons to winning the championship, and in dire need of a replacement for their injured pitcher during a training camp, Kojima involves himself in a game of One Outs, only to lose to a normal fastball from the seemingly invincible Tokuchi.\r\n\r\nMesmerized by his prowess, Kojima recruits Tokuchi to the team after narrowly avoiding defeat in a rematch, believing he might just be their key to victory. However, the greedy owner of the Lycaons refuses to give him a decent salary, leading Tokuchi to suggest an unusual contract: every out he pitches will gain him five million yen, but every run he gives up will lose him fifty million yen. With his fate now tied to that of the team, Tokuchi's fight to bring the Lycaons to victory becomes yet another gamble—the very thing that he does best.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As his health is failing, most of the family believe he doesn't have much time left. So as a typhoon rages on outside, so too does the storm in their hearts as they squabble amongst themselves over the inheritance and the claim of being Kinzou's rightful heir.\r\n\r\nBattler, Kinzou's grandson, has returned to Rokkenjima after a six year absence, expecting the gathering to go smoothly. However, his eccentric grandfather has other plans; he enacts a bizarre game, challenging everyone to find his hidden gold. The one who finds it also receives the most coveted reward of all: the leadership of the family. However, their game is beset with violence and murder when the participants are used as \"sacrifices\" to revive the Millennial Witch of Rokkenjima, Beatrice.\r\n\r\nEver the skeptic, Battler doesn't believe in the occult. But when so many around him turn up dead, he is forced to question whether it was the work of magic or the machinations of someone among them.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As Keiichi settles in, he meets some local girls who quickly become his steadfast group of friends: Satoko Houjou, Rika Furude, Rena Ryuuguu, and Mion Sonozaki. While their life is mostly carefree and fun-filled, he begins to discover that things in Hinamizawa are not as they appear to be.\r\n \r\nDuring the annual Cotton Drifting Festival, Keiichi learns that there have been murders and disappearances for the past few years in the aftermath of the celebration. Referred to as \"Oyashiro's Curse,\" the suspicious townsfolk say that those who anger Hinamizawa's patron god will be cursed to die or disappear. At first, he believes that such things are mere folk tales meant to scare misbehaving children. But when a murder and a disappearance occur after the festival and his friends refuse to talk about the strange events in the village, Keiichi begins to wonder if his new friends may have something to do with the horrific events—and if he might be the next to die.\r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After the sudden, gruesome death of the Monou siblings' mother, Kamui was taken away from Tokyo by his own mother. In the years that passed, the two lived peacefully while Kamui strengthened his innate telekinetic abilities. When his mother passes away in 1999, her dying wish prompts him to return to Tokyo to face his \"destiny.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Kamui reappears in the city, his attitude has taken a drastic turn, and he displays the growth of his powers through violent confrontations in the streets. Various opponents come after him asking if he is \"Kamui,\" but they seem to be demanding something far more significant than his name. These fighters represent two opposite factions—the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth—who each wish to recruit him to their cause. Piecing together clues about the apocalyptic \"promised day,\" Kamui realizes that he holds the fate of the world in his hands. Depending on which group of Dragons he allies himself with, he can either choose to save the world—or end it.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is how it has always been, and it is no different for Kasane Fuchi's late mother, Sukeyo—a famous stage actress whose charming image and acting prowess have captivated the world.\r\n\r\nKasane aspires to be an actress like Sukeyo once was. Yet, although she possesses incredible acting abilities, Kasane looks nothing like her mother. In fact, her visage leads many people to wonder if the two are even related. Due to her appearance, Kasane is bullied and ostracized by her peers at school. This makes her dream seemingly impossible to achieve, where good looks are assets in the acting industry.\r\n\r\nHowever, Kasane's life takes a turn for the better when she remembers her mother's words—to wear her lipstick and kiss whoever she desires. Much to Kasane's astonishment, the first person she kisses while wearing the lipstick causes her to temporarily switch faces with them. Now given a chance to pursue her ambitions, to what lengths will Kasane use this newfound power?\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But what awaited the majority of them was poverty, discrimination and hopelessness. Manhattan, New York was full of immigrants flooding through the ports and the 6th district, Five Points, was considered at the time, the world's worst slum. The mobsters corrupted the entire area, including the police by paying them off; Five Points was the mob's territory and they were the law.\r\n\r\nBut even in Five Points, where there seemed to be nothing but robbery, prostitution and murder, showed some signs of hope. Luke Burns was a honest and righteous teenager who realized that the mob was the cause of the harsh lifestyle and that joining the mobsters would not bring him the American dream. But his older brother, Brad Burns, had become the assassin to the biggest mob group of Five Points, the Grave Diggers, a secret he kept from Luke for his own protection. Brad was known as the Grim Reaper and his reputation preceded him as a ruthless and skilled killer.\r\n\r\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

When the girl, named Yuzuko Mawatari, targets Natsuo from the crowd and extends an invitation to her, she becomes irritated with her demeanor and accepts the request in an attempt to discover why Yuzuko seems to be so carefree.\r\n\r\nBut while Natsuo participates in the mixed martial arts club, people from her past still have a bone to pick with her.

Her mother, Ye Feii, was Taiwan's top model, and her father was also a model, until a tragic airplane crash left Lele without parents.\n\nTherefore it is no surprise that Lele hates the industry, thinking it superficial and unnecessary. Raised by her paternal grandmother, Lele reaches seventeen before she is sucked in by her mother's sister, Ye Feihung, a fashion agent (and former model) who \"convinces\" the reluctant Lele to pose. Lele is adverse to the whole idea, until she sees a photo shoot of popular American model Angus Lanson, and she begins to see modeling as an art form.\n\nWhen Aunt Feihung's magazine editor invites Angus Lanson to a meeting of all the top fashion ambassadors, Lele is invited along and is curious to meet Angus. She does not know that Angus' twin elder brother, Eros Lanson, is secretly accompanying his brother. This obviously leads to confusion and is the start of a charming story of Lele's goals: Fashion in New York city, becoming a top model, and love? \n\n(Source: ShoujoMagic)",

Swearing vengeance on her killers, Aika's older brother, Mahiro, sets out to determine who ended her life prematurely. Unbeknownst to Mahiro, his childhood friend and Aika's secret longtime boyfriend, Yoshino Takigawa, ends up getting dragged into the investigation after being held at gunpoint by a strange woman. Yoshino learns that Mahiro is being investigated by the government after outbreaks of a mysterious \"iron sickness\" in two locations where he was previously seen. Now on the run, Mahiro and Yoshino's search for Aika's killers becomes harder and more dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to find a lead on his sister's murder, Mahiro strikes a deal with Hakaze Kusaribe, the most powerful sorceress in the world who is imprisoned on a deserted island. As princess and leader of the Kusaribe Clan, Hakaze promises to aid Mahiro's investigation if he can rescue her from internment. Once free, Hakaze intends to put a stop to the revival of the \"Tree of Exodus\" and save the world from eventual ruin. Believing that Hakaze will get in the way of his resurrection plans, Samon Kusaribe, Hakaze's former aide, had orchestrated her banishment and also removed her ability to use magic on the island.\r\n\r\nIn a desperate attempt to save the world from the effects of the \"Trees of Exodus and Genesis,\" Mahiro and Yoshino inch closer to the truth behind Aika's death. The two find that there might be more to her murder than they initially thought as the world around them falls into chaos.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, one girl survives (Saya Kota) and opens another Suicide Club, with other victims. Her best friend, Kyoko, fears for Saya's future and begins to search for the strange secrets surrounding the Suicide Club to try and save Saya and the other girls from committing such a tragedy again.",

            "synopsis": "In the late 19th century, the British Empire has become a global power. Due to the strict class stratification, the average citizen has little chance of successfully rising up to the top, where the despicable nobility rules over them all.\r\n\r\nWilliam James Moriarty, the second son of the Moriarty household, is a young mathematics professor who has displayed great cunning and intellect since he was a child. Along with his brothers Albert and Louis, he lives the simple life of a noble. Outside of school, William is a well-known private consultant willing to solve the problems of anyone in need. However, his gentle demeanor belies his position as the head of a group prepared to wreak havoc in pursuit of its desire—a new world built from the ashes of the old.\r\n\r\nYuukoku no Moriarty puts a new spin on Arthur Conan Doyle's original work by putting the spotlight on its main antagonist and exploring how he came to be the first and only \"criminal consultant.\"\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He works hard to save up in order to go on the high school trip, because he has promised his four best friends that they will all go together. However, after the class' money is all collected, it's stolen! Suspicion falls on two of Yuuichi's friends, Sawaragi Shiho and Shibe Makoto.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the five of them are kidnapped, and wake up in a strange room with a character from a short-lived anime. Apparently, one of them has entered them into a \"friendship game\" in order to take care of their massive debt. But who was it, and why did they have such a debt? Could they have stolen the money from class to pay for entry into the game? Yuuichi and his best friends will have to succeed in psychological games that will test or destroy their faith in one another.\r\n\r\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
